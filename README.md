# Data Engineering Case Study for AdvertiseX

## Introduction
This project addresses data engineering challenges at AdvertiseX, a digital advertising technology company. The solution focuses on data ingestion, processing, storage, and monitoring for ad impressions, clicks/conversions, and bid requests.

## Data Ingestion
### Architecture
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion.
- **Batch Processing**: Apache Spark for batch data ingestion.

### Data Sources
- **Ad Impressions (JSON)**: Ingested via Kafka.
- **Clicks and Conversions (CSV)**: Processed using Spark structured streaming.
- **Bid Requests (Avro)**: Collected using Kafka.

## Data Processing
### Transformation
- Standardize formats (e.g., JSON to Parquet).
- Enrich data with metadata.

### Validation & Deduplication
- Validate schemas using Spark.
- Deduplicate based on unique identifiers.

### Correlation
- Join ad impressions with clicks/conversions using user ID and timestamps.

## Data Storage
### Storage Solution
- Raw data: Amazon S3 or HDFS.
- Processed data: Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery.

### Optimization
- Partition data by date and ad campaign.
- Use indexing and materialized views for faster queries.

## Error Handling and Monitoring
### Error Handling
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors.
- Centralized logging with ELK Stack.

### Monitoring
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
- Set up alerts for data anomalies and delays.

## Implementation
### Ingestion Pipelines
- Kafka consumers and producers for real-time data.
- Spark jobs for batch processing.

### Processing Pipelines
- Spark transformations for cleaning and enrichment.
- Aggregation and correlation jobs.

### Storage and Querying
- Data lake storage with S3 or HDFS.
- Analytical queries on Redshift or BigQuery.

### Error Handling and Monitoring
- Centralized logging with ELK, Prometheus, and Grafana.
- Automated alerts and dashboards for issue resolution.

## Conclusion
This solution provides a scalable and robust data engineering pipeline for AdvertiseX, ensuring efficient data handling, processing, and insightful analysis for ad campaign optimization.
